# McRegion
{: .no_toc }
McRegion is the format in which Minecraft Worlds were stored, starting with Beta 1.3 and ending with Release 1.1. This page will largely go into how exactly reading and writing of these files cane be done, instead of going into many details such as alternative compression formats, as [the article on the Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Region_file_format) already covers this quite thoroughly.
